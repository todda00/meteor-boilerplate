Meteor Boilerplate
------------------------

A mostly internal Meteor Boilerplate for getting a Meteor project up and running. I wish to provide more documentation at some point, but wanted to get this published as is for now. 

This is roughly modeled after Differential's boilerplate https://github.com/Differential/meteor-boilerplate
